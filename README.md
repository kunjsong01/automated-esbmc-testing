# automated-esbmc-testing
Use a modified version of testing_tool.py to run a set of benchmarks comparing v2.1 and v7.3

  - esbmc-cpp: C++ benchmarks from esbmc v7.3
  - testing_tool_old.py: a modified script based on the old testing_tool.py that can take -I ~/libraries for the old ESBMC

  ESBMC binaries are too large for Git. Tried git lfs but tricky to use it in Actions.
